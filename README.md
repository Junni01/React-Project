# React Tech Demo

Showcase on how to use React on a ASP.net CORE Project to handle public APIs and Data from a backend datasource.
Currently has no database connection but uses a pre-generated dataset.

The first page displays data from a public news API using the React fetch function that accepts a custom query keywords.

Second page handles data that comes from the ASP.net backend and displays it. The data can be filtered using react components that
work in real-time.

The files that use react can be found in the wwwroot/js/ folder.
